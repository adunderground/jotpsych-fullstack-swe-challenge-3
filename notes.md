THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FILE IN THE ENTIRE REPO! HUMAN WRITING ONLY! NO AI ALLOWED!!

I'm using Cursor to crack this challenge.
My mac did an update last night and my xcode broke so I wasted 10 minutes installing python. Dumb.


Challenge #1
setRecordingTime was not being properly updated. Hardcoded value "5" was used instead of MAX_RECORDING_TIME variable

Challenge #2
added new state variable isTranscribing
set isTranscribing state appropriately when transcription starts/finishes 
add "Transcribing..." during the transcrption
logic disables the recording button during the transcription

Challenge #3
created toast.tsx component to show if the version mismatch is detected
updated variable currentVersion to clientVersion in APIService.ts to make a clear destinction b/w client and API versions. send "X-Client-Version" and "X-User-ID" headers in the request to backend. 
backend now sends the X-API-Version as part of the responce. APIService checks if there is a version mismatch. 

to test this functionality I updated "clientVersion" in APIService.ts to 
~~~
private clientVersion: string = "0.0.9";
~~~

Challenge #4
This is where things got a bit more challenging for me. I brainstormed the solution with Cursor.
changed the /transcribe endpoint to immediately return job id
added new endpoint /job-status/<job_id> for polling individual job status
in APIService.ts we have a new interfaces for checking  job's status and response, and getJobStatus method for status checking. 
AudioRecorder has instanceId prop for identifying each unique transcription. 
updated App.tsx to support multiple recording instances simultaneously, display status for each job individually

Challenge #5
This part of the challenge I was comfortable with again, thank to my previous exeprience. 
We first create a new endpoint "/generate-user-id" that generates and returns a uuid4 ID. 
than we added UserIDService.ts on frontend to hit a new endpoint, get and set the user id 
App.tsx now calls getUserID if no user ID found it will call the backend to generate one.
All API calls now include userID in headers. 

Challenge #6
app.py now has a "categorize_transcription" method that checks user's prefered ai model and based on the preference calls the "categorize_transcription" method. this is where Cursor started hallucinating pretty badly and I didn't have time to debug/improve it. I think overall this challenges asks for a clear prompt that we send over to the preferred LLM with our request, somethink like:

You are an expert content analyst. Analyze the following transcription and categorize it into specific interest areas.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object. No additional text, explanations, or markdown formatting.

REQUIRED JSON STRUCTURE:
{{
    "primary_interest": "string - the main category this content belongs to",
    "confidence": float - confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0,
    "subcategories": ["array", "of", "specific", "subcategories"],
    "sentiment": "positive|negative|neutral",
    "topics": ["array", "of", "related", "topics"]
}}

ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
- primary_interest: Choose from: Automotive, Wildlife, Marine Exploration, Technology, Sports, Arts, Science, Travel, Food, Music, Literature, or other relevant categories
- confidence: Base on how clearly the content fits the category (0.0 = unclear, 1.0 = very clear)
- subcategories: 2-4 specific subcategories that refine the main interest
- sentiment: Analyze emotional tone and enthusiasm in the content
- topics: 3-5 related academic or practical topics

TRANSCRIPTION TO ANALYZE:
"{transcription}"

RESPONSE FORMAT: Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text.

Challenge #7 
I'd have to read up on the best practices on how to cache/identify delta between LLM calls to optimize the process for challenge #7. 

Challenge #8 
I was very excited to work on this one because I got a ton of experience on the front end and have some really fun experiments with Cursor generated pretty front-end applications. Check out my latest fun project where I got to use some pre made components as well as openai-gpt-image-mcp to beautify it â€“ https://pizzapass.surge.sh/
