THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FILE IN THE ENTIRE REPO! HUMAN WRITING ONLY! NO AI ALLOWED!!

I'm using Cursor to crack this challenge.
My mac did an update last night and my xcode broke so I wasted 10 minutes installing python. Dumb.


Challenge #1
setRecordingTime was not being properly updated. Hardcoded value "5" was used instead of MAX_RECORDING_TIME variable

Challenge #2
added new state variable isTranscribing
set isTranscribing state appropriately when transcription starts/finishes 
add "Transcribing..." during the transcrption
logic disables the recording button during the transcription
